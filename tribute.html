                <h2><u>Missle Man Of India</u></h2>
                <p>
                    Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 
                    2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
                     decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian
                    Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile
                    development efforts[1] . He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic 
                    missile and launch vehicle technology[2][3][4] . He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's 
                    Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

                <p>
                    had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.[21] After completing his education
                    at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli,
                    then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.[22] He moved to Madras in 1955 
                    to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research
                    Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.
                    Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III 
                    projects, both of which proved to be successful.Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister 
                    Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear
                    tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role
